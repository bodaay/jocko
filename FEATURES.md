# Quafka Feature Checklist

Comparison of Kafka features vs Quafka implementation status.

**Legend:**
- ✅ Implemented & Verified (tested with Kafka client)
- 🧪 Implemented & Unit Tested (not verified with real client)
- 🚧 Partial / In Progress
- ❌ Not Implemented

> **Note:** After audit (Jan 2025), we found the FEATURES.md was created by reading code, 
> not by actual testing. Only features marked ✅ have been verified with Sarama client.

### What's Actually Verified with Kafka Client (Sarama):
- ✅ Produce messages
- ✅ Fetch/Consume messages  
- ✅ Metadata (cluster, topics, partitions)
- ✅ CreateTopics

### What Needs Real Client Testing:
- 🧪 Consumer Groups (JoinGroup, SyncGroup, Heartbeat, etc.)
- 🧪 Offset management (Commit, Fetch)
- 🧪 DeleteTopics
- 🧪 ListOffsets
