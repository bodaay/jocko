# Quafka 🦆

![CI](https://github.com/bodaay/quafka/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Kafka/distributed commit log service in Go.

*Quafka = Kafka + Go (sounds like a duck!) 🦆*

## Goals

- Implement Kafka in Go
- **Protocol compatible with Kafka** so Kafka clients and services work with Quafka ✅
- Make operating simpler
- Distribute a single binary
- Use Serf for discovery, Raft for consensus (no ZooKeeper dependency)
- Smarter configuration settings
    - Able to use percentages of disk space for retention policies rather than only bytes and time kept
    - Handling size configs when you change the number of partitions or add topics

> **Note:** Kafka client compatibility has been verified with [Sarama](https://github.com/IBM/sarama). See `_examples/sarama/` for a working example.

## What's Changed (from Jocko)

This is a **fully modernized fork** of Jocko with significant updates:

- ✨ **Consumer Groups** - Full consumer group protocol support (JoinGroup, SyncGroup, OffsetCommit, etc.)
- 🚀 **Go 1.23** (was 1.12)
- 📦 **All dependencies updated** (sarama, raft, serf, uuid, etc.)
- 🔧 **Bug fixes** - Protocol decoder, leader election, panic handling
- 🧹 **Code quality** - Removed panics, gotos, debug prints
- ⚡ **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions with linting
- 📝 **Package rename** - Internal package renamed from `jocko` to `quafka`

👉 **See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the complete list of changes.**

*If you're migrating from Jocko, the CHANGELOG has a migration guide.*

## Acknowledgments

This project is a modernized fork of [Jocko](https://github.com/travisjeffery/jocko), originally created by [Travis Jeffery](https://github.com/travisjeffery). Travis did the heavy lifting of implementing the Kafka protocol in Go and designing the distributed architecture using Raft and Serf. His work on Jocko and the accompanying blog posts laid the foundation for this project.

The articles he wrote are excellent resources for understanding distributed systems:
- [Building a Kafka that doesn't depend on ZooKeeper](https://medium.com/the-hoard/building-a-kafka-that-doesnt-depend-on-zookeeper-2c4701b6e961)
